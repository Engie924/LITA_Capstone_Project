### Project Overview
---
This Project aims to effectively and accurately evaluate and enhance the sales performance of a retail store of an organization by systematically analyzing sales data. The project involves identifying trends, opportunities, measuring, and interpreting key performance indicators (KPIs) , identify high- and low-performing areas, and optimize sales operations. By leveraging data-driven insights, this analysis will provide actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies, get better customer engagement, and drive business growth.

### Objectives
---
My objective is clear: to uncover actionable insights and present them in a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard. This project was a multi-phase effort encompassing data exploration, SQL querying, and data visualization.

### Data Sources
---
The primary data source used here is the Sales Data provided by the Github.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel: [LITA Capstone Dataset (P).xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17550195/LITA.Capstone.Dataset.P.xlsx)
  1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis
   3. For Data Summary
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering Data 
- Power BI - For Data Visualization of insights found in Excel and SQL
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Methodology
---

Phase 1: Excel 

I started by diving into the sales data using Excel. Pivot tables helped me summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I didn't stop thereâ€”Excel formulas were utilized to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region. A thorough initial exploration revealed interesting trends and patterns which laid the foundation for my deeper analysis. A screenshot is in my files
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, i prepared the following actions:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting: the data cleaning process was done using Excel to remove duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---

After cleaning the data in Excel, i started the analysis and dashboard creation. In Excel, the following steps were carried out:

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated basic statistics and analyzed distributions.

**Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns.

**Dashboard Creation:** Developed interactive dashboards to present key findings effectively.

 ### Data Analysis
 ---
 This is where I included some basic lines of code or queries and even some of the DAX functions used during my analysis

 **Analysis Questions**
 - Perform an initial exploration of the sales data. Use pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region, and month.
 - Use Excel formulas to calculate metrics such as average sales per product and total revenue by region.
 - Create any other interesting report
 - retrieve the total sales for each product category.
 - find the number of sales transactions in each region.
 - find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
 - calculate total revenue per product.
 - calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
 - find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
 - calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
 - identify products with no sales in the last quarter
 - Create a dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL. The dashboard should include a sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns.

**Approach**

Each question was addressed using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and charts to determine significance and identify key trends.

**Insights with SQL**

With my dataset loaded into SQL Server, i crafted queries to pull out critical insights:

Total Sales by Product Category: I identified the total sales by each or the products with Soes = 613,380, Jacket = 208,230, Hat = 316,195, Socks = 180,785, Shirt = 485,600, and Gloves = 296,900. The categories with the most revenue is Shoes. done

Sales Transactions in Region: I measured the volume of sales across different regions. North - 2481, East - 2483, South - 2480, West- 2477.


Highest-Selling Product: found the top product by total sales value to be Shoes - 613,380

Revenue Per Product:  I calculated how much each product contributed to overall revenue.

Monthly Sales Totals: I tracked sales trends throughout the current year.

Top 5 Customers: I highlighted the most valuable customers based on purchase amounts.

Percentage Sales Contribution by Region: was analyzed as well

Products with no sales in the last quarter Wwas identified.
