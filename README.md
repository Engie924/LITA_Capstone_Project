### Project Overview
---
This Project aims to effectively and accurately evaluate and enhance the sales performance of a retail store of an organization by systematically analyzing sales data. The project involves identifying trends, opportunities, measuring, and interpreting key performance indicators (KPIs) , identify high- and low-performing areas, and optimize sales operations. By leveraging data-driven insights, this analysis will provide actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies, get better customer engagement, and drive business growth.

### Objectives
---
My objective is clear: to uncover actionable insights and present them in a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard. This project was a multi-phase effort encompassing data exploration, SQL querying, and data visualization.

### Data Sources
---
The primary data source used here is the Sales Data provided by the Github.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel: [Download Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GhpbKiXRyB4eSqaAIWdomrBeae667N9K/edit?gid=377935022#gid=377935022)
   1. For Data Cleaning
   2. For Analysis
   3. For Data Summary
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering Data
- Power BI - For Data Visualization of insights found in Excel and SQL
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Methodology
---

Phase 1: Excel 

I started by diving into the sales data using Excel. Pivot tables helped me summarize total sales by product, region, and month. I didn't stop thereâ€”Excel formulas were utilized to calculate key metrics like average sales per product and total revenue by region. A thorough initial exploration revealed interesting trends and patterns which laid the foundation for my deeper analysis. A screenshot is in my files
At the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, i prepared the following actions:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting: the data cleaning process was done using Excel to remove duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---

After cleaning the data in Excel, i started the analysis and dashboard creation. In Excel, the following steps were carried out:

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculated basic statistics and analyzed distributions.

**Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns.

**Dashboard Creation:** Developed interactive dashboards to present key findings effectively.

 ### Data Analysis
 ---
 This is where I included some basic lines of code or queries and even some of the DAX functions used during my analysis
